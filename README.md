# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

I feel kind of weird about advertising for Mr. Hartl in the readme, but on the 
other hand, I'm benefiting from his tutorial for free, so I guess a little 
acknowledgement is pretty reasonable.
